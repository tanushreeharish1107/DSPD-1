## Energy Trading Record Management System for Smart Grid

This program manages energy trading transactions in a smart grid environment. It tracks energy sales between sellers (producers) and buyers (consumers) and provides various functionalities to optimize and analyze trading operations.

### Features:
1. **Add New Transactions**: Input transactions with details such as Transaction ID, Buyer ID, Seller ID, Energy Amount, Price per kWh, and Timestamp.
2. **Display All Transactions**: View all stored transactions with detailed information.
3. **Transaction List by Seller/Buyer**: Generate transaction lists for each seller and buyer.
4. **Time Period Filter**: List transactions that occurred within a specified time period.
5. **Max Transaction Month**: Identify the month with the highest number of transactions.
6. **Total Revenue by Seller**: Calculate and display total revenue generated by a specific seller.
7. **Sort Sellers by Revenue**: Sort sellers based on the revenue they generated.
8. **Largest Energy Transaction**: Identify the transaction with the highest energy amount traded.
9. **Sort Transactions by Energy**: Sort transactions based on energy amount.
10. **Sort Buyers by Energy Bought**: Sort buyers by the total energy they have purchased.
11. **Max Transactions between Seller/Buyer Pairs**: Identify the pair with the most transactions.
12. **Sort Seller/Buyer Pairs by Revenue**: Sort seller/buyer pairs based on the total revenue exchanged.

### Data Structures Used:
1. **Transaction Structure**:  
   This structure represents each transaction and contains essential details such as Transaction ID, Buyer ID, Seller ID, Energy Amount (kWh), Price per kWh, and Timestamp. It helps in tracking individual transactions efficiently.

2. **Seller and Buyer Structures**:  
   - **Seller**: Holds the Seller ID and total revenue generated from their transactions.
   - **Buyer**: Stores the Buyer ID and the total energy bought by the buyer.
   These structures are used to store and manage aggregated information about sellers and buyers for further analysis.

3. **Arrays of Structures**:  
   Arrays of `Transaction`, `Seller`, and `Buyer` structures store multiple entries, allowing efficient management and retrieval of data, especially as the number of transactions grows.

4. **Sorting and Filtering**:  
   The program employs sorting algorithms to order transactions by attributes like energy amount or revenue. It also uses filtering to query transactions that occurred within specific time periods.

5. **Hash Maps (Future Implementation)**:  
   For future scalability, hash maps or hash tables could be implemented to optimize lookups, such as tracking seller/buyer pairs or managing transaction history efficiently.

### Key Concepts:
1. **Time Complexity Considerations**:  
   The program is designed to handle large datasets with efficient sorting and filtering operations, ensuring it performs well even as the number of transactions grows.

2. **Data Consistency**:  
   Care is taken to ensure the accuracy of financial data, especially for revenue calculations, using proper handling of floating-point values to maintain precision.

3. **Modular Design**:  
   Functions are structured modularly to handle different tasks (e.g., adding transactions, displaying data, calculating revenue), ensuring ease of maintenance and scalability.

4. **Scalability**:  
   The system is built to handle increasing transaction volumes and can be extended to support additional trading features, such as dynamic pricing, energy contracts, or integration with external trading platforms.
